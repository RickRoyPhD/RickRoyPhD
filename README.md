- 👋 Hi, I’m @RickRoyPhD.
- 👀 I’m interested in creating an Arduino-based BLE device and appropriate state-machine code for Arduino and iOS (and maybe Android).
- 🌱 I’m currently (not really) learning Swift.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on really bare-bones code for the Arduino to report its battery level, and the iPhone to display it.
- 📫 How to reach me: just my first name @ genomesurfer.com
